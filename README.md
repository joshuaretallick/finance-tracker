# Finance Tracker app

For this app I wanted to try hooking up and external API to track stock prices and also explore the functionality of many to many relationships via friends requests and tracking.  Unlike previous projects, I took advantage of Rails scaffolding and generators, plus Devise for authentication so I could ramp up the application quickly.

## Installation Instructions
- Clone Repo to your local machine
- From Command Line enter directory and then run:
```sh
bundle install
yarn
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails server
```
- Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
